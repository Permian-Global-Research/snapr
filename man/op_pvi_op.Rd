  operator_id,
  sourceProduct,
  resampleType = "None",

}
\arguments{
\item{operator_id}{character operator id}

\item{sourceProduct}{The source product(s) as input to the operator}

\item{resampleType}{If selected band s differ in size, the resample method
used before computing the index Value must be one of 'None', 'Lowest
resolution', 'Highest resolution'. Default value is 'None'.}

\item{redFactor}{The value of the red source band is multiplied by this
value. Default value is '1.0F'.}

\item{nirFactor}{The value of the NIR source band is multiplied by this
value. Default value is '1.0F'.}

\item{angleSoilLineNIRAxis}{Soil line has an arbitrary slope and passes
through origin. Default value is '45.0'.}

\item{redSourceBand}{The red band for the PVI computation. If not provided,
the operator will try to find the best fitting band.}

\item{nirSourceBand}{The near-infrared band for the PVI computation. If not
provided, the operator will try to find the best fitting band.}

\item{downsampling}{The method used for aggregation (downsampling to a
coarser resolution). Value must be one of 'First', 'Min', 'Max', 'Mean',
'Median'. Default value is 'First'.}

\item{upsampling}{The method used for interpolation (upsampling to a finer
resolution). Value must be one of 'Nearest', 'Bilinear', 'Bicubic'. Default
value is 'Nearest'.}
