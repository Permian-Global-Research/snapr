<!-- badges: end --> snapr is a proof of concept R package to interact
with [The ESA Sentinel Applications Platform
(SNAP)](https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/) from R. SNAP provides
an impressive set of tools for processing satellite data, many of which
are not available in the wider R ecosystem. snapr is a wrapper for
SNAPâ€™s Graph Processing Tool (command line interface) and shares
similar ambitions to the
[SNAPISTA](https://github.com/snap-contrib/snapista) python library.

## Installation

You can install the development version of snapr like so:

``` r
#install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Permian-Global-Research/snapr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(snapr)
## basic example code
```
